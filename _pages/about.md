I am a PhD student at FICS Research, University of Florida (USA), advised by Dr. Thomas Shrimpton. I hold an MS in Computer Science from University of Florida, and a BTech in Computer Science from NIT Rourkela (India). After my BTech, I worked as an engineer for Samung Research Institute, Noida for two years followed by a two year teaching stint at KIIT, Bhubaneswar (my hometown).

My research lies at the intersection of Cryptography and Hardware Security. In particular, I am interested in analysing security problems such as intellectual-property theft and counterfeiting, in the integrated-circuit supply chain using principles of modern cryptography.

Life outside work and research: I love sports (tennis, table tennis/ping pong and cricket), write poems and songs occasionally, and like cooking (of course, eating too).
